# Emotion-Detection-DL
This code incorporates a deep learning pipeline for Facial Emotion Recognition using the FER2013 dataset. The model classifies facial expressions into one of seven categories, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-based emotion classification. Below is a summary of the code:

    Data Loading and Exploration:
        The dataset is loaded from the FER2013 CSV file.
        It contains pixel values representing grayscale images of size 48x48 and an emotion label.

    Data Preprocessing:
        Pixel Processing: Each image's pixel data (stored as space-separated strings) is converted into a 48x48 NumPy array.
        Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] for better model performance.
        Reshaping: Images are reshaped to add a channel dimension, making them compatible with CNN input requirements.
        One-Hot Encoding: Emotion labels are converted into a categorical format with seven classes.

    Dataset Splitting:
        The dataset is split into training and testing subsets with an 80-20 ratio for model evaluation.

    Model Architecture:
        A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built using the TensorFlow/Keras library, consisting of:
            Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max-pooling for feature extraction.
            A fully connected layer with dropout for regularization.
            A softmax output layer for multiclass classification.
        The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

    Data Augmentation:
        The training data is augmented with techniques such as rotation, width/height shifts, and zoom to increase model robustness and prevent overfitting.

    Model Training:
        The model is trained for 20 epochs using augmented training data and validated on the test set.

    Model Evaluation:
        The trained model is evaluated on the test set, reporting:
            Test loss and accuracy.
            Classification accuracy using accuracy_score.
            Predictions made on the test set using the trained model.

    Potential Improvements:
    Experiment with additional CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
    Incorporate transfer learning with pretrained models for better performance.
    Use advanced data augmentation techniques or increase the number of epochs for improved accuracy.
    Visualize predictions and misclassifications to gain further insights.

This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for facial emotion recognition, showcasing an end-to-end pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
